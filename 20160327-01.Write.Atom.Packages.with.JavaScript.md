# Write Atom Packages with JavaScript

Currently, you can write packages for **Atom** using CoffeeScript. But it is possible to do that with ES2015 too (see [How to Write Atom Packages Using Vanilla JavaScript](http://www.sitepoint.com/write-atom-packages-using-vanilla-javascript/)).

If you take a look at the project [atom/package-generator](https://github.com/atom/package-generator) *(this is the Atom bundled package to generate package)*, you can see this commit [Add support for JS package generation](https://github.com/atom/package-generator/commit/aeed190bbf28483bf8811957aba0b726f5c249f1). That's nice, but this is for the `1.0.0 release` of the package and currently, the installed version is `0.41.0`.

*only tested with OSX*

## How to use the next version of package-generator?

Generally, when you develop your own **Atom** package the default directory is `~/github`, so, type these commands in a terminal:

```
cd github
git clone https://github.com/atom/package-generator.git
```

Then you can see that you have now, two "package-generator" packages with 2 different version numbers:

### Change the generator behaviour

Click on the button settings of the `1.0.0` version of the package, and set the value of `Package Syntax` rubric to `JavaScript`:

### Use it!

Now, type `Cmd+Shift+P` *(OSX shortcut)*, search for `package generator` and select `Generate Package`:

Then, type the name of your package (ie:`my-package`), and type enter. So, you'll get a "pure" JavaScript (ES2015) package skeleton:
